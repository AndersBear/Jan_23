       Greedy vs. Dynamic thinking.<br><br>
       other factors could include:<br>
       <b>1.</b>  weighted (a value added to each unit, requires more processing)<br>
       <b>2.</b>  duplicates allowed ("unbounded")<br>
       <b>3.</b>  fractional (objects broken into smaller objects)<br>
       <b>4.</b>  if the numbers are uniform (close together on the number line) vs. wildly spread<br><br>
       Sometimes you might just want a quick solution.  The greedy algorithm takes less processing.<br>
       The dynamic algorithm requires more processing, but results in the best solution.<br><br>
      <br><br>
	  Perhaps the difference between how the algorithms work concerns the number of passes they make.
	  For example, let's look at this set of numbers: [8, 3, 1, 7, 6].
	  The greedy algorithm will hold the first number, add the 1 and then quit when it gets to the end.
	  That doesn't make ALL possible comparisons, because ... what about letting the 8 go?
	  (In other words, what about solutions that DON'T include the 8?)
	  The dynamic algorithm makes as many passes through the set of numbers as it takes to compare
	  ALL possible permutations.  In this case, the dynamic algo chooses 3 + 7.
	  AND 3 + 1 + 6?  Sheesh!  Why didn't you tell me!<br><br>
